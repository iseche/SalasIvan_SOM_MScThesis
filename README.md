This is a script for making Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with MATLAB and importing data from Excel files.
The script is part of my Master's thesis of the MSc in Industrial Engineering Research at the University of Cantabria.
The library "somtoolbox" version 2.0 developed by the Computer Science Department of the Aalto university is used (more info on: https://research.ics.aalto.fi/software/somtoolbox/).
